# Contact Form | Vue 3 | VeeValidate

A very basic contact form made with Vue 3 and VeeValidate. There are four text fields and radio buttons. The form is built with custom components, that is why **Composition API** is used. The project is inspired by two VueMastery courses - [Vue 3 Forms](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/vue3-forms/forms-introduction) and [Validating Vue 3 Forms](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/validating-vue3-forms/why-vee-validate).
